# Blog project

This is my project of website, where I used mostly html, css (scss), a bit of JS and plain PHP for backend. Website runs on MySQL from XAMPP.
Front-end part was just for better visual effects and keep a project pleasing for an eye. Main aim of it was to implement some backend functionalities. All data are managed by cookies and database in MySQL, which was set locally. To have better insight, let's look at screenshots divided it into section:

## Main page: ##
* display all posts in shorten version, sorted by descending creation date
* adapt nav bar to current logged user

  #### For GUEST ####

  #### For USER ####

## Contact ##

* I included also contact panel, but I didn't implement any mailing there. More like for "fullfiling the page"

Surely there can be much more done here, but idea of project was to have a little fun with basic CRUD, cookies and generally create website more dynamic in terms of provided data, not just static HTML. 

Hope you like it.
